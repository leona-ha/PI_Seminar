This repository contains content for a Data Science and Machine Learning Introduction Class for Psychology Students.
The dataset used is the OSMI 2016 Survey https://osmihelp.org/research, covering Mental Health in the Tech industry.

The first Notebook, [Tech_Survey_Session1](https://github.com/leona-ha/PI_Seminar/blob/master/Tech_Survey_Session1.ipynb) contains an introduction into uploading data to a Pandas Dataframe, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.

The second Notebook, [Tech_Survey_Session2](https://github.com/leona-ha/PI_Seminar/blob/master/Tech_Survey_Session2.ipynb) contains instructions to predict Health Utilization behavior using three models: 1. Logistic Regression, 2. Support Vector Classifiers, 3. Deep Learning and compare model performance. 

There is an additional notebook, [NLP_Exkurs](https://github.com/leona-ha/PI_Seminar/blob/master/NLP_Exkurs.ipynb), covering an introduction to Natural Language Processing on free-text features of the OSMI dataset. 

Please note that the content is mainly in German. Contact me, if you need the lecture videos guiding through the Notebooks.
